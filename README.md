## acceptance_criteria
Portfolio requirements include presenting the developer's name, recent photo, and navigation links to sections: about, work, and contact information. Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls to the corresponding sections. The "project" section displays titled images of the developer's applications, with the first image larger. Clicking on these images directs the user to the deployed applications. The portfolio must also exhibit a responsive layout, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.
